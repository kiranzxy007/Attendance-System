3) Task is to convert the above punches into attendance import format where-in only in time (first punch of the day) and out time (last punch of the day) need to be captured for each day for evey employee (If there are punches for that day).
   If there is only one punch in a day for any employee, both in time and out time will be same.
   If there are no punches for an employee on any day, no need to have any row for that employee for that particular day.
   All date and time formats must be same as that of the sample output.

4) Code written in Python
